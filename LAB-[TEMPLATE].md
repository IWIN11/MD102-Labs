# LAB-000 — Enable Mobile Device Management (MDM)  TEMPLATE

## Goal (target state)
- Enable tenant-level MDM so Intune can manage devices.
- Evidence: MDM authority/config shows as enabled / set to Intune.

## Portal path (to be confirmed)
- Intune admin center → [TODO: exact menu path]

## Key settings (to be confirmed)
- MDM authority = Intune  (or equivalent setting shown in portal)
- [TODO: any additional setting if prompted]

## Validation (evidence) — TODO
- Screenshot: `img/001-mdm-status.png`  (upload later)
- What it proves: MDM is enabled and tenant is ready for enrollment.

## Status
- WIP / Done
