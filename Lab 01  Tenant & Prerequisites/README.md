# Lab 01 — Tenant & Prerequisites

## Purpose
Establish tenant readiness for MD-102 labs, confirm Intune licensing/authority, and standardize evidence capture.

## Evidence (Source of Truth)
All prerequisite evidence is maintained in the environment folder:

- Environment Setup: [00-Environment/00-ENV-SETUP.md](./00-Environment/00-ENV-SETUP.md)

## Notes
- Evidence screenshots use the `ENV-xx` / `00-Environment` naming convention because they are shared prerequisites for multiple labs.
- Lab numbering (Lab 01/02/03) is independent from the evidence folder naming.
