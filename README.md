# MD-102 / Intune Labs (WIP)

This repo documents my hands-on MD-102 learning through reproducible Intune labs.

## Start here

- Environment setup (Intune tenant / licenses / tenant status): [00-Environment/00-ENV-SETUP.md](./00-Environment/00-ENV-SETUP.md)
- Labs index (all labs): [labs/](./labs/)

## Evidence standard (for every lab)
Each lab includes:
- Goal (target state)
- Portal path (where the setting lives)
- Key settings (what I changed)
- Validation (screenshot + what it proves)
- Status + date

## Current progress
- LAB-000: Template created (in progress)
